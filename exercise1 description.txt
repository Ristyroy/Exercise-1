Exercise-1

A collection is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate group of objects.
	In this project  contains a collection of 10 items.Each item contains itemId,itemShortDescription,itemPrice and itemBrand. We can use List to store List of items.So I create three packages named as 
1)com.exercise.managerPackage
2)com.exercise.objects
3)Ex1. 
	Details of each package

1)com.exercise.managerPackage contains the class called Ex1Main.java, it contains methods that we are used in the program. I use three methods 
	1)getSortedList()
		This method is used to sort list of items based upon the highest price.
	2)filterByT()
		This method is used to filter items based upon their brandname starts with T.
	3)createItemList()
		This method is used to create list of items.

2)com.exercise.objects contains the class called Item.java.
	Here I should declare the variables that used is used in the program.And also use getter and setter methods to return and set values to the variables
	
3)Ex1 contains the classs called Ex1Main.java.
	The program execution starts from here and also we can call methods and print the details from here.
